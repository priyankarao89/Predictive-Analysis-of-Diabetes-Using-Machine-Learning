# Predictive-Analysis-of-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes outcomes based on a publicly available dataset. I applied data preprocessing, feature selection, and implemented various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
